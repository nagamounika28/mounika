        <h>HEALTHY DIET</h><hr>
        <p> A <b>healthy diet</b> is a diet that maintains or improves overall<strong> health</strong>. A healthy diet provides the body with<i> essential nutrition</i>: fluid, <em>macronutrients </em>such as protein, micronutrients such as vitamins, and adequate fibre and food energy. <sub>[2][3]</sub>

           A healthy diet may contain <mark>fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</mark>, and may include little to no ultra-processed foods or<u> sweetened beverages</u>. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although additional sources of <mark>vitamin B12</mark> are needed for those following a vegan diet.[4] Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy.<u> Nutrition facts</u> labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.<sup>[5][6]</sup></p>

        <p>"<b>Junk food</b>" is a term used to describe food that is <i>high in calories</i> from sugar and/or fat, and possibly sodium, making it <mark>hyperpalatable</mark>, but with little dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, or other important forms of nutritional value.<sub>[1][2][3]</sub> It is also known as <u>HFSS food</u> (high in fat, salt and sugar).[4] The term junk food is a pejorative dating back to the 1950s.[5] Many different kinds of <del>junk food</del> can be easily found in most supermarkets and fast food restaurants. Because of such easy access to it, people are most <sup>likely to consume it</sup>. [6]</p>
